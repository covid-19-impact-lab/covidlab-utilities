The beliefs and behavior of a population are paramount to fight the CoViD-19 epidemic.
Because of this, knowing and understanding people's attitudes and expectations on this topic
are central for policy makers and scientists alike.

The CoViD-19 Impact Lab conducted a comprehensive survey with over 5000 Dutch men and women on these topics.
The results can be expected to be similar in Germany and other Western societies.

The survey focused on questions regarding risk assessments and risk mitigation behaviors,
opinions on the political actions taken and changes and expectations regarding job security
and the economy in general.

How have different groups adapted to the economic and social changes?
How much do people follow the recommended behavior changes?
How much have the new regulations affected their ability to work and how do they cope with closure of schools at the same time?

You can explore the answers in two different ways. Firstly, there is a tab with maps,
where you can see how different regions of the Netherlands answered these questions.

If you are more interested in the behavior of different groups, such as whether the elderly
practice more social distancing, you can go to the Group Differences tab.
In each you can choose different topics and subtopics that interest you.
To get additional information on the question and answers,
hover your mouse over the map or plot.

have suffered more from the current crisis than more educated workers who have succesfully
started working more from home.
