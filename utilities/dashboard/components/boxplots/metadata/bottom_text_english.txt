The graph displays the absolute difference in time spent with the youngest child between mothers and fathers for 
two-parent opposing gender households split by different socio-demographic characteristics (<b>gender care gap</b>). 
It shows that mothers on average carry more of the additional childcare burden, however, this is driven by mothers 
working part-time or not working at all pre-pandemic. In households in which mothers worked full-time before the 
pandemic, the gender care gap does not increase. Additionally, the ability of fathers to work from home also 
cushions the effect of the closure of school and childcare facilities on the gender care gap.
