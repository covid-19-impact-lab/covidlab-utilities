The closure of school and childcare facilities from mid-March to May 2020 led to an extra time burden on parents. 
Parents had to take care of children while keeping with their normal working life. Here we illustrate how parents 
divided this additional burden among each other according to their socio-demographic characteristics.

The data was collected in April 2020 in the midst of the first wave of the pandemic. If survey participants had 
a child in school or younger, they were asked how many hours they spent taking care of their child before the 
closure of school and childcare facilities as well as in the last week before the survey. Participants were 
additionally asked how many hours their partner -- if applicable took care of the children. Participants were 
asked these questions about their youngest child in two age groups: children not yet in school, and children in 
school age.
