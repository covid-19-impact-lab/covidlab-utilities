The Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands has prompted the Dutch government to impose restrictions on the economic and social life 
to impede the spread of the coronavirus. 

<br><br>
In mid-March, all schools and childcare facilities were closed along with restaurants, cafes, bars, and several other businesses 
involving personal contacts. 
<br> 
Beginning in May, the restrictions were gradually lifted. Daycare facilities
and primary schools started opening in mid-May, businesses such as hairdressers and beauty saloons were allowed to accept customers 
again. 
<br> 
In the beginning of June, secondary schools started opening; restaurants, cafes, and cinemas could operate under restricted capacity. 
<br> 
With the main exceptions of bans on larger (inside) gatherings, the requirement to wear masks in public transport, and the
mandate to keep a distance of 1.5 meters to other people, in June and September the social and economic life was largely back to what it was before.
