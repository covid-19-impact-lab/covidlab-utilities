After economic restrictions were introduced in mid March, average working hours decreased by 12% although the unemployment rate only midly increased.
During the lockdown, working hours kept on decreasing and reached a minimum at 82% of pre-pandemic working hours in May.
As restrictions were lifted, working hours started increasing again, but the economy did not fully recover.
In September, average working hours still only totaled 86% of pre-pandemic working hours.
This loss in working hours is not equally distributed across the socioeconomic spectrum
and job characteristics. Further, the underlying dynamics change between the lockdown period and post-lockdown.

<br> <br>
During lockdown, the ability to work from home
and being an essential worker have a preserving effect on working hours.
As the level of education is strongly correlated with the ability to work from home, the working hours of highly educated
workers are better preserved than those of lower educated workers.
These lockdown-specific mechanisms become much
less important as social distancing restrictions are eased between May and September as do other
socio-economic determinants. This is unlikely caused
by pandemic-induced supply changes. Diminished demand is a more plausible explanation.

The sample is restricted to individuals that are between the ages 18 and 66 and worked at least 10 hours in one of the periods (Early March-September).
