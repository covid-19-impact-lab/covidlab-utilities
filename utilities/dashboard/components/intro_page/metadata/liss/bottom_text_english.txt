The Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands has prompted the Dutch government to impose restrictions on the economic and social life 
to impede the spread of the coronavirus. 

<br><br>
In mid-March, all schools and childcare facilities were closed along with restaurants, cafes, bars, and several other businesses 
involving personal contacts. 
<br> 
Beginning in May, the restrictions were gradually lifted. Daycare facilities
and primary schools started opening in mid-May, businesses such as hairdressers and beauty saloons were allowed to accept customers 
again. 
<br> 
In the beginning of June, secondary schools started opening; restaurants, cafes, and cinemas could operate under restricted capacity. 
<br> 
With the main exceptions of bans on larger (inside) gatherings, the requirement to wear masks in public transport, and the
mandate to keep a distance of 1.5 meters to other people, in June and September the social and economic life was largely back to what it was before.

After economic restrictions were introduced in mid March, average working hours decreased by 12% although the unemployment rate only midly increased.
During the lockdown, working hours kept on decreasing and reached a minimum at 82% of pre-pandemic working hours in May.
As restrictions were lifted, working hours started increasing again, but the economy did not fully recover.
In September, average working hours still only totaled 86% of pre-pandemic working hours.
This loss in working hours is not equally distributed across the socioeconomic spectrum
and job characteristics. Further, the underlying dynamics change between the lockdown period and post-lockdown.

<br> <br>
During lockdown, the ability to work from home
and being an essential worker have a preserving effect on working hours.
As the level of education is strongly correlated with the ability to work from home, the working hours of highly educated
workers are better preserved than those of lower educated workers.
These lockdown-specific mechanisms become much
less important as social distancing restrictions are eased between May and September as do other
socio-economic determinants. This is unlikely caused
by pandemic-induced supply changes. Diminished demand is a more plausible explanation.

The sample is restricted to individuals that are between the ages 18 and 66 and worked at least 10 hours in one of the periods (Early March-September).
