The closure of school and childcare facilities from mid-March to May 2020 led to an extra time burden on parents. 
Parents had to take care of children while keeping with their normal working life. Here we illustrate how parents 
divided this additional burden among each other according to their socio-demographic characteristics.

<br> <br>
The data was collected in April 2020 in the midst of the first wave of the pandemic. If survey participants had 
a child in school or younger, they were asked how many hours they spent taking care of their child before the 
closure of school and childcare facilities as well as in the last week before the survey. Participants were 
additionally asked how many hours their partner -- if applicable took care of the children. Participants were 
asked these questions about their youngest child in two age groups: children not yet in school, and children in 
school age.

The graph displays the absolute difference in time spent with the youngest child between mothers and fathers for 
two-parent opposing gender households split by different socio-demographic characteristics (<b>gender care gap</b>). 
It shows that mothers on average carry more of the additional childcare burden, however, this is driven by mothers 
working part-time or not working at all pre-pandemic. In households in which mothers worked full-time before the 
pandemic, the gender care gap does not increase. Additionally, the ability of fathers to work from home also 
cushions the effect of the closure of school and childcare facilities on the gender care gap.
