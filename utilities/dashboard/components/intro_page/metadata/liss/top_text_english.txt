The beliefs and behavior of a population are paramount to fight the CoViD-19 epidemic.
Because of this, knowing and understanding people's attitudes and expectations on this topic
are central for policy makers and scientists alike.

The CoViD-19 Impact Lab conducted a comprehensive survey with over 5000 Dutch men and women on these topics.
The results can be expected to be similar in Germany and other Western societies. For more information on the data you can click <a href= "https://covid-19-impact-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> here </a>.

The survey focused on questions regarding risk assessments and risk mitigation behaviors,
opinions on the political actions taken and changes, household divison of labor, expectations regarding job security
and the economy in general.

How have different groups adapted to the economic and social changes?
How much do people follow the recommended behavior changes?
How much have the new regulations affected their ability to work and how do they cope with closure of schools at the same time?
